                        <p>
                            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written<br> 
                            as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published), almost every<br> 
                            email I've ever written, has been written on machines created by Apple I<br>
                            interacted online using an Apple machine long before ever encountered a<br> 
                            PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid.<br>
                            And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be<br> 
                            missed, Mr Jobs Thanks for all your amazing work<br>
